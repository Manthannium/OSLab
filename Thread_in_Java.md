# Thread in Java
```
Threads execute in parallel like processes but have more control and communication
```
```java
class xyz implements Runnable 
public void run() 
int i; 
for (i=0;i<5;it+) 
System.out.print(i); 
try{Thread.sleep(1000):} 
catch(Exception e){ 
class kapil 
public static void main(String ar[}) throws Exception 
xyz k;Thread a,b; 
k=new xyz( );a=new Thread(k): 
b=new Thread(k): 
a.start( ); 
System.out.print("x"): 
Th
```
Practical Application
```
various types of outputs can be generated using suitable combination of a.start(), a.run() and Thread.sleep(x)
```
